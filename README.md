# About
This is an incomplete clone of **Terry Cavanagh's Copycat**. Currently only 5 powers are implemented.

Copied from [Terry's itch.io page](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/copycat):

> Turn based action game.
> 
> Defeat enemies to absorb their power.
> 
> Destroy the mimic crystal to ascend.

*(note: I didn't made that crystal in this clone!)*

# More info

I made this clone about 3 years ago (2021). So please bear with my spaghetti code >_<

This was originally [for the hp prime calculator](https://www.hpcalc.org/details/9348). I later added `hpprime.py` and `urandom.py` so it can run on computers. Delete these two files and the game is ready to run on the calculator.

and the game has no sound because the calc don't have speakers :P Totally not my laziness

# Usage

Use `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` or something similar to install the required libraries. (right now it's just **pygame**)

and run the `main.py` and you are good to go!

If you **don't** have python installed you can download the `exe` in the **Releases**.
